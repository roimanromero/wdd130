    <p>Hi! how is it going? I just wanted to introduce myself to the group. I'm Roiman, i am 21 years old, but i will be 22 on september 25th, and I'm really excited to be part of this class with all of you. </p>
    <p>First things first, I'm a huge Marvel fan. I mean, who can resist the charm of superhero movies, right? From Iron Man's suit to the epic Avengers battles and the adventures of the Guardians of the Galaxy, I'm all in for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (specially form ironamn, since day one!) .</p>
    <p>Apart from that, I'm also really into EDM music, house, chill, like Martin Garrix style. And when I'm not listening to EDM, you'll probably find me tinkering around with music production software like FL Studio. It's a fun hobby that lets me get creative.</p>
    <p>On the personal side, I've got a sister who's 28 years old. We're pretty close, and I cherish the time we spend together.</p>
    <p>Oh, and I can't forget to mention my love for technology and gadgets. I'm a bit of a tech geek, and I'm always keeping up with the latest gadgets and tech trends.</p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you better, both inside and outside of the classroom. Whether we're talking Marvel heroes, EDM tracks, music production, or the coolest tech out there, I'm all ears. Let's make this semester a blast!</p>
